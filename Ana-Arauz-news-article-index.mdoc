		<p>Did you know that Polar bears can also communiate through sight, touch, and smell?  Polar bears usually make contact by gently touching or mouthing to each other around the face and neck. They can also proceed to back up on their hind legs and try to push each other over with their forepaws.  That's pretty cool!</p>
